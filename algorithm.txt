1. Basic image manipulations - Thresholding.
2. Crop out approx. sudoku puzzle (contour)
3. Get the grid square vertices:
   3.1. Get the largest contour of the image.
   3.2. Get the largest bounding rectangle within the contour.
   3.3. Compute the grid corners. (a better way of doing this is required!)
5. Do a Warp perspective on the sudoku image. 
6. We will extract cells from this, by slicing the sudoku grid evenly.
7. Digit isolation in cell is done through a series of steps:
    7.1. Extracting the largest connected component in the image,
         giving more priority to the center pixels.
    7.2. Removing all major noise in the cell. 
    7.3. Centering of digits after extraction.
